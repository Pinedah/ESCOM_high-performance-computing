# High-Performance Computing (HPC)

## ðŸ“Œ Course Overview
This repository contains materials, notes, and projects related to the **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** course as part of the **Data Science degree at IPN**. The course focuses on designing and implementing high-performance computing systems using **parallel computing, distributed systems, and GRID architectures**.

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered
1. **High-Performance Computing Architectures**
   - Types of HPC architectures
   - Parallel processing systems
   - Distributed computing systems
   - GRID computing architectures

2. **Parallel Computing**
   - Multiprocessors and multicomputers
   - Interconnection networks
   - Parallel algorithms
   - Parallel programming (HPF, OpenMP, PVM, MPI)

3. **Distributed Systems**
   - System models and architectures
   - Process communication and concurrency control
   - Distributed transactions and replication
   - Fault tolerance and high availability

4. **GRID Computing Architectures**
   - GRID resources and virtual organizations
   - GRID computing standards (OGSA, OGSI, OGSA-DAI)
   - GRID software and tools
   - Performance metrics and optimization

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
To follow along with the course materials and projects, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of **computer architecture and parallel computing**
- Familiarity with **distributed systems and networking**
- Python and relevant HPC libraries installed (e.g., `mpi4py`, `CUDA`)
